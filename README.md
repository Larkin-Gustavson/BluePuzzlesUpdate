# Blue Puzzles

Blue Puzzles is an application that contains a collection of puzzles.
These games include Hangman, Jigsaw, Sudoku, Sudoku X, Memory, Time Attack, and Tents.
This is a GUI-based application,
as such all parts of it are entirely visual.
A user would interact with this game in the same way they would with a website
(click buttons to interact with the application).

If you enjoyed using this application,
you can email me at <larkingustavson@gmail.com>.
If you have any suggestions for improvements
it would be greatly appreciated!

Sincerely,

Larkin
